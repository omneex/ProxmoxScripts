## Usage

Example for description and example commands in each script in this repository:

- **Remote Migrate VMs** (`RemoteMigrateVMs.sh`):
  This script migrates virtual machines (VMs) from a local Proxmox node to a target Proxmox node.
  It utilizes the Proxmox API for migration and requires proper authentication using an API token.
  The script removes any existing Cloud-Init drives before initiating the migration and adjusts VM IDs based on a provided offset.

  Usage:
    ```bash
    ./RemoteMigrateVMs.sh <target_host> <api_token> <fingerprint> <target_storage> <vm_offset> <target_network>
    ```

  Where:
    target_host - The hostname or IP address of the target Proxmox server.
    api_token - The API token used for authentication.
    fingerprint - The SSL fingerprint of the target Proxmox server.
    target_storage - The storage identifier on the target node where VMs will be stored.
    vm_offset - An integer value to offset the VM IDs to avoid conflicts.
    target_network - The network bridge on the target server to connect the VMs.
