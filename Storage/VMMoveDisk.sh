# This script facilitates the migration of virtual machine (VM) disks across different storage backends on a Proxmox VE environment.
# It iterates over a specified range of VM IDs and moves their primary disks (assumed to be 'sata0') to a designated target storage.
# This is useful for managing storage utilization, upgrading to new storage hardware, or balancing loads across different storage systems.
#
# Usage:
# ./VMMoveDisk.sh start_vmid stop_vmid target_storage
#   start_vmid - The starting VM ID from which disk migration begins.
#   stop_vmid - The ending VM ID up to which disk migration is performed.
#   target_storage - The identifier of the target storage where disks will be moved.
# Example:
#   ./VMMoveDisk.sh 101 105 local-lvm
