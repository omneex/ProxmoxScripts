# This script automates the process of updating the storage location specified in the configuration
# files of virtual machines (VMs) on a Proxmox server. It is designed to bulk-update the storage
# paths for a range of VM IDs from one storage location to another. This can be useful in scenarios
# where VMs need to be moved to a different storage solution or when reorganizing storage resources.
#
# Usage:
# ./VMConfigChangeStorage.sh <start_id> <end_id> <hostname> <current_storage> <new_storage>
#   start_id - The starting VM ID for the operation.
#   end_id - The ending VM ID for the operation.
#   hostname - The hostname of the Proxmox node where the VMs are configured.
#   current_storage - The current identifier of the storage used in the VMs' configuration.
#   new_storage - The new identifier of the storage to replace the current one.
# Example:
#   ./VMConfigChangeStorage.sh 100 200 pve-node1 local-lvm local-zfs

# Check if required inputs are provided
if [ $# -lt 5 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <start_id> <end_id> <hostname> <current_storage> <new_storage>"
    exit 1
